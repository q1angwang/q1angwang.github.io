## About me
I am a PhD student at IIE, CAS for Cybersecurity under the supervision of [**Feng liu**](https://fengliu.net.cn). I obtained my bachelor degree in Information-Security from Xidian University.

My research interest lies in Network Traffic Defense, with a focus on Red-team traffic and Exploit traffic.
